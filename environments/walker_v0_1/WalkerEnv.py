class WalkerEnv_v01(BaseEnv):
    """
    A reinforcement learning environment for the robodog to learn to walk.

    Specific to the walker_v0 environment is, that the reward function is hard coded to learn a gait routine.
    In contrast to the walker_v1 environment, the reward function is not based on the acceleration of the robot.

    Args:
        max_episode_steps (int): The maximum number of steps per episode. Defaults to 10.
        sleep_time (float): The time to wait between sending actions and receiving the next state. Defaults to 0.0.
        verbose (bool): Whether to print additional information. Defaults to False.

    Attributes:
        action_space (gym.spaces.Box): The continuous action space in the range [-1, 1].
        observation_space (gym.spaces.Box): The state space consisting of 4 sensor readings and the distance to the wall.

    Methods:
        sample_random_action(): Samples a random action from the action space.
        normalize_state(state: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray: Normalizes and clips the state to be compatible with the agent.
        reset() -> np.ndarray: Resets the environment and returns the initial state.
        reward(state: np.ndarray, action: np.ndarray, next_state: np.ndarray) -> Tuple[float, bool]: Calculates the reward based on the change in distance to the wall.
        step(action: np.ndarray) -> Tuple[np.ndarray, float, bool, bool, dict]: Performs the given action and returns the next state, reward, done status, and truncation status.
